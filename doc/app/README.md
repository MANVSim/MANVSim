# MANVSim Flutter App

The App is developed in the [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) Framework for easy multiplatform
development.

### API library

This app uses an API library automatically generated from the [OpenApi Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)
in [doc/server/api_game/api.yaml](../server/api_game/api.yaml).  

To regenerate this library (e.g. after changes) run `generate.sh` in [app/api/](../../app/api/).
